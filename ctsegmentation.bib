  abstract       = {In the recent years a great deal of research work has
                   been devoted to the development of semi-automaticand
                   automatic techniques for the analysis of abdominal CT
                   images. Some of the current interests are theautomatic
                   diagnosis of liver, spleen, and kidney pathologies and
                   the 3D volume rendering of the abdominalorgans. The
                   first and fundamental step in all these studies is the
                   automatic organs segmentation, that is stillan open
                   problem. In this paper we propose our fully automatic
                   system that employs a hierarchical graylevel based
                   framework to segment heart, bones (i.e. ribs and
                   spine), liver and its blood vessels, kidneys,
                   andspleen. The overall system has been evaluated on the
                   data of 100 patients, obtaining a good assessment
                   bothby visual inspection by three experts, and by
                   comparing the computed results to the boundaries
                   manuallytraced by experts.},
